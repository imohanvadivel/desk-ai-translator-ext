## Important Note:
Zoho Desk loads extensions inside an iframe, which by default does not grant access to local ML models. To enable the extension to function properly, you need to manually override the iframe permissions by adding the following attributes to the allow parameter:

```html
<iframe allow="language-detector; translator;">
    ...
</iframe>
```

or you can simply select the ifrom in your developer tool and paste the following command in your console, now refresh the extension and you are good to go.

```js
$0.setAttribute("allow", "language-detector; translator;");
```
